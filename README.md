Our objective is to create the functionality for the steering wheel of the UofL formula race car using arduino. The wheel has paddleshifters, an lcd touch screen, and an LED strip to display RPMs. 

Paddle Shifters:
  Shift up with the right paddle, shift down with the left paddle. The shifters control a relay which sends power to a pneumatic pump that    actuates the gear shifter in the engine.
Screen:
  Display MPH, RPM, and Current Gear
  
 RPMs:
  RPMs will be retrieved using a Hall Effect sensor to calculate the RPMs on the crankshaft of the car.
  RPMs will be displayed on screen and using an led strip with lights incrementing as RPMs increase.
